title: Victoria Sponge
description: This Victoria Sponge is uses a simple 1:2:2:2 of eggs, flower,
  sugar and butter. It is very simple to make and one can have a filling of jam,
  cream, or butter icing, with a sprinkle of icing sugar on top. The ingredients
  can be scaled up or down however you want, but the cooking time will vary.
ingredients:
  - amount: 4
    desc: eggs
  - amount: 8
    desc: oz caster sugar
  - amount: 8
    desc: oz flour
  - amount: 8
    desc: " oz butter, soft"
instructions:
  - step: 1
    desc: Turn the oven to 180°C (356°F). Line two cake tins with greaseproof paper.
  - step: 2
    desc: Cream the butter and sugar together with a wooden spoon. The end result
      should be a paste where the butter and sugar are merged as one.
  - step: 3
    desc: Add an egg to the mixing bowl and whisk until smooth. Do this with the
      remaining eggs - the resulting batter should be smooth with no lumps.
  - step: 4
    desc: Sift half of the flour in and fold the batter to incorporate the flour.
      This will add air to the mix and allow for a good rise. Repeat with the
      remaining flour until all incorporated.
  - step: 5
    desc: Divide the batter between the two cake tins and put into the oven. After
      15 minutes, remove the cakes and put a thin object (e.g. a knife or a
      cocktail stick) into the center - if it comes out with mix on, it still
      needs a few more minutes to cook. Once out of the oven, leave until fully
      cooled.
  - step: 6
    desc: Move the cakes from the tins. One side should be flat and the other side
      should be slightly round. Place both cakes so that the round side is on
      the top.
  - step: 7
    desc: "Spread jam onto one of the cakes and cream/butter icing onto the other
      side. Then place the two sides together like a sandwich. "
  - step: 8
    desc: Use a sieve to lightly dust the top of the cake with icing sugar. It is
      now ready to eat - enjoy!
